                Hi! My name is <strong>Jesper Svoldgaard</strong>. I’m a 29-year-old Computer Science student at
                <strong> EASV (Erhvervsakademi SydVest)</strong>, studying for an AP Degree in Computer
                Science (Datamatiker).
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Before beginning my studies, I worked for 9 years in freight and logistics, which taught me
                structure, communication, and problem-solving — skills I now apply in software development.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
                I live in <strong>Vejrup near Bramming</strong> with my wife and our three kids. During my
                studies, I’ve worked with technologies like <strong>Java, JavaFX, MySQL, C#, React,
                TypeScript, CSS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Docker,</strong> and <strong>Fly.io</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
                I’ll complete my education in <strong>January 2027</strong> and am excited to continue
                growing as a developer.
            </p>
